An anecdote some of you might
heard of is intruding into my
subconsciousness...
In your fruity yet deceptive
eyes, we missed the juicy core
of your lie
So let me sharpen all of your
eyes
Put an end to this to save
another life
(No one escapes.) From the shiny
names
(No one escapes.) And the
reverse of fame
(No one escapes.) Next to you
(No one escapes.) He exists
I was the one who was taken in
by your words
You were the one who slaughtered
the mockingbird
Spit it out! Spit it out! Spit
it out!
And now, break in to break out!
They say that house is haunted
We all know your head is WANTED
I don't care if you're guilty
Spill your guts in front of me
Same is lame
Are you telling me that
repetition is all you can aim?
Quit playing dirty little tricks
in the dark, let me punch you
up in your face (P! K!)
Don't hate me man, hate the
fuckin game, homie, 'cause you
never put a name!
Our good old memories?!
I don't need a single bit
Soon they will all explode
I'm coming so leave your door
open now
Nobody's ever gonna dig you out
Fake ass! Not a word given so
far
Way too funny talking about
moral with you
All these people, so forgetful,
right under your mind-control
(Hell no!)
You write like you act, end in a
garbage bag
Don't you smudge the name of the
"lyricist"! (WHAT!)
Where is your GHOST! GHOST!
GREEDY GHOST!
What the hell makes you think
that you can turn lies into
gold?
GHOST! GHOST! DIRTY GHOST!
Your satellite virus
Soon they will all explode
Keep it real
The face right under your mask
The fading trace of your past
Counting down with an righteous
hourglass
When you're gone, I'll be
raising my glass
Now it's too late to regret
Down on your knees to confess
Just another rope unless
You put it around your neck
When get caught, I don't think
you'll admit
Just come up with some stupid
dumb shit
Taboo makes everthing taste
juicy?
HA?! Just do it (do it)
What a shallow ghost
Wearing the stigma like a medal
Your rusted stone
How your story moans
Nothing close to my love and
hate spinoff
Stand up! Always ready to go
Try to switch the mode to
compose on your own?
Counterfeit numbers to get you
in the zone
My counterstrike's gonna break
your bone
I don't give a damn about it
Little by little, hard work's
what got me here
EI YO! Producing music's my
daily routine
This bomb's THE brand new shit!
Hey boy, look where you at
Now you are nothing but a
marionette
In this game, I am the Mario off
we go
Justice is defined by paper and
pen you know
Ghost, the lying bitch and
Thunderbolt...
Full of fucking BULLSHIT!
Time for bloody legit
demonstrations
Bow to this! (Hell yeah)
"Art's an explosion"!
I am the GHOST! GHOST! You
drained my soul!
I will break the curse and never
go back into your bowl
GHOST! GHOST! Out of control!
The message you wrote
Just another joke
GHOST! GHOST! GREEDY GHOST!
What the hell makes you think
that you can turn lies into
gold?
GHOST! GHOST! DIRTY GHOST!
Your satellite virus
Soon they will all explode
